== RNg: Rails/Angular Seed project

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

> RNg is set to use Rails 4.2.3

* System dependencies

* Configuration
> jQuery inclusion is commented out from both the Gemfile and application.js
> Ensure that any changes in Vagrant/provisioning or database.yml are kept in sync with each other

* Database creation
> This is automated with vagrant on first-time provisioning

* Database initialization
> This is also automated on provisioning. Simply re-provision if you need to run `rake db:migrate` again.

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
